🚀 **Stock Prediction with LSTM, SMA Strategies & SHAP Explainability**  

## **🔹 Overview**  
This project is a **comprehensive stock market analysis tool** that integrates **machine learning, technical analysis, and explainability techniques** to enhance financial decision-making.  
It leverages **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for stock price prediction**, **Simple Moving Averages (SMA) for trend analysis**, and **SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) for interpretability**.  

## **🔹 Key Features & Steps**
1️⃣ **Real-Time Stock Data Extraction**  
- Uses **Yahoo Finance API** to download stock market data.  
- Supports multiple stock tickers & customizable time periods.  

2️⃣ **Stock Market Trend Analysis with SMA**  
✔ Computes **SMA (Simple Moving Averages) - 30-day & 60-day** for trend identification.  
✔ Generates **Buy/Sell signals** based on SMA crossover strategy.  

3️⃣ **Stock Price Prediction using LSTM**  
✔ Prepares **time-series data for LSTM training** using **MinMax Scaling**.  
✔ Trains an **LSTM model with sequential layers** to predict future stock prices.  
✔ Evaluates model accuracy using **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) & MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**.  

4️⃣ **Model Interpretability with SHAP (Explainability)**  
✔ Uses **SHAP values to explain LSTM model predictions**.  
✔ Visualizes **feature importance using SHAP summary plots**.  

5️⃣ **Interactive Streamlit Dashboard**  
✔ Provides an **interactive UI** to explore stock trends & predictions.  
✔ Displays **live stock charts, SMA crossovers, and LSTM predictions**.  

## **🔹 Technologies Used**
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, SHAP)**  
- **Yahoo Finance API (yfinance) for real-time stock data retrieval**  
- **Machine Learning Models (LSTM for time-series prediction)**  
- **Streamlit for Interactive Web Dashboard**  

## **📌 Why This Project Matters**
This project **bridges technical analysis with machine learning** to provide **data-driven insights for stock trading**.  
By integrating **LSTM for predictive analytics and SHAP for explainability**, it ensures transparency and **better investment decisions**.
